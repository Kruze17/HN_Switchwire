***These are the repositories you will need to visit in order to get required STL files and more information. I just simply cannot host them in my repo as the creators have put so much effort and time in building and documenting their own versions of designs. Peace.***

1. The X-carriage BL Touch mod for Switchwire was made for e3d V6 Hotend only. So i have decided to drop it.
   After several suggestions regarding the BL touch not perforimg well in a fully enclosed printer, i decided to
   go with an inductive probe. But it's creator M. Kanawati was kind enough to offer me custom design files
   sepcific for my hotend. But as i have said, i am moving towards inductive probe.

2. Added the rail guides for MGN12H linear rails and 4040 extrusion rail guide as per subscribers' request.

3. Added the modified the x-axis drag chain anchor for euler extruder for switchwire, in case you guys want it.
